run go mod init:      "$ go mod init "example.com/<name of my app>" or "github.com/me/<name of my app>"
create the framework: "$ kickfyne framework"

üöß THE FRAMEWORK:
The framework is contained in 3 folders.
1. backend/ which contains the back end code.
2. frontend/ which contains the GUI code.
3. shared/ which contains shared code.

üî® BUILDING THE APP:
