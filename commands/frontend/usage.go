The front-end's user interface is built with screen packages. A screen package is composed of panels and a messenger. The panels are how the screen package interacts with the user, displaying content and accepting user input. The messenger is how the screen package communicates with the back-end, sending and receiving messages.

For example a screen might have a panel where the user selects a record to edit and then another panel for editing the record. Meanwhile the messenger is communicating with the back-end getting records for selection, a record for editing, and sending the edited record to the back-end for storage and switching panels.

Alternately, the above screen with two panels could be done with two screens. One screen with only a select panel and the other screen with only an edit panel.
