â—Š A buttons YAML file will create (not add) multiple buttons, tabs, panels in the application.
â—Š The only 3 times you can create buttons are
  1. After building the framework using the command "$ kickfyne framework".
  2. After removing all of the buttons, tab-bars and panel-groups using the command "$ kickfyne frontend clear".
  3. After individually removing each button with it's tab-bar and panel-groups using the command "$ kickfyne frontend button remove <button-name>".
â—Š All buttons and tabs and panels remain in the order they appear in the YAML file.
â—Š There are only 2 kinds of buttons.
  1. A button with panels.
  2. A button with tabs.
